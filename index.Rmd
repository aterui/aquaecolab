Our group at UNC Greensboro studies **Aquati**c ecosystems with approaches in **Qu**antitative **E**cology. We are particularly excited about combining theoretical, statistical, and field-based approaches to address fundamental and applied questions in spatial ecology. Inquiries?

Current key topics in our group include the following:

**River network complexity** -- Rivers recurrently join to form a fractal branching network, in which geometric properties (e.g., branching patterns) remain similar across spatial scales. We are interested in how this "scale-invariant" complexity drives ecological systems. We tackle this question with mathematical models and big-data synthesis. Core part of this project has recently been funded by NSF ([link](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2015634&HistoricalAwards=false)).

**Context-dependent dispersal** -- Dispersal is a fundamental process that mediates disease spread, spatial dynamics, and food webs. Although dispersal is often assumed to be a "stochastic" event in population/community ecology, behavioral ecologists have long recognized that dispersal is triggered by internal (e.g., body size) and/or external (e.g., disturbance) factors. We are interested in integrating behavioral aspects of dispersal into population and community ecology.

**Cross-system trophic interactions** -- Ecosystems are not a stand-alone entity; rather, they are connected through resource flux across ecosystems. We are interested in how aquatic and terrestrial food webs are connected through animal migration (e.g., the emergence of aquatic insects), and how food web interactions mediate transfer of energy across ecosystems.

**Wetland conservation** -- Wetlands are one of the most threatened ecosystems with \> 80% loss at some states since 17th century. Wetland conservation/restoration is now a nation-wide initiative, but where is the best place to conserve? This question is critical to increasing the benefit of conservation efforts in human-dominated landscapes where . We use quantitative modeling coupled with metapopulation/metacommunity theories to identify important areas to maintain regional population persistence of wetland species.
