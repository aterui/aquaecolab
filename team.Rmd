**Ashley LaRoque**, Ph.D student -- Being from Minnesota, my love of freshwater started at a young age. I grew up never more than a half mile from a lake. This allowed me to explore aquatic ecology at a young age. As I dove deeper into my education at the University of Minnesota, I realized the importance of freshwater ecology and earned my Bachelor's degree in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior. My previous research quantified how temperature change in lakes has impacted the phenology of spawning in freshwater fish. I also have experience on a stable isotope project looking at the impact of invasive species on predatory fish. As a Ph.D. student in Environmental Health Sciences at UNCG, my research revolves around stream ecology. I am working on a mark-recapture study using passive integrated transponder tags to understand fish behavior. Outside of my research in fisheries, I love to go fishing, cook, play with my cat Hudson, and go hiking.

**Dr. Timothy Lee**, Postdoc -- I am originally from Seoul, South Korea and raised in the Pacific Northwest, where I have acquired my long-standing fascination with aquatic ecosystems. Over the years, I have participated in many exciting projects across the world, including sampling demersal fishes in the Sea of Japan and surveying benthic macroinvertebrates in Oregon and Washington’s continental shelf habitats just to name a couple. In collaboration with researchers at the University of Washington and Washington Sea Grant, I also completed an assessment on coastal macroinvertebrate community responses to shoreline armoring removal in the Puget Sound’s coastlines. During my PhD, I completed a large-scale biogeographic study along the U.S. east coast to describe patterns of free-living and parasitic invertebrate communities associated with invasive alga Gracilaria vermiculophylla, and understanding prevalence of parasitic barnacles along salinity gradients in the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers of North Carolina. As a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Terui’s lab, I am interested in determining which environmental predictors influence complex food web dynamics in riverine systems using quantitative approaches.

**Melanie Stadler**, Ph.D student -- I grew up in the middle of Kansas, with incredible parents who encouraged my love of nature and wanting to learn about the world around me. While earning a bachelor's degree in Biology from UNCG, I was introduced to the world of turtle and tortoise biology and conservation. I earned an MS in Biological Sciences and GIS certificate from Florida Atlantic University, studying the habitat and foraging ecology of juvenile green turtles on nearshore reefs in Florida. Prior to returning to North Carolina, I worked as a Sea Turtle Biologist in Florida for eight years where I supervised two nesting beach programs, participated in some amazing research projects, and managed the overhaul and daily operations of two sea turtle rehabilitation centers. I am interested in spatial ecology, ecological biogeography, and habitat connectivity, especially in turtles and other herp species. I am excited to be part of UNCG's Department of Biology, Environmental Health Science PhD program, and I plan to focus my PhD research on threatened bog turtles and their wetland habitat in North Carolina. I live with my husband, Brian, our bearded dragon, and two dog children in Greensboro. In my spare time, you will find me running or biking on one of our extraordinary local hiking trails, birdwatching, curled up with a good book, or in the kitchen experimenting with a new vegetarian recipe.

**Dr. [Akira Terui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H9OuCKsAAAAJ&hl=ja&authuser=1)**, PI -- I'm interested in spatial ecology in general. My research career started at the University of Tokyo where I studied metapopulation structure of the endagered freshwater mussel *Margaritifera laevis*. After obtaining Ph.D., my research interests expanded. Thus far, I studied freshwater mussels, fish, aquatic and terrestrial insects, plants, and seabirds in collaboration with excellent researchers across the globe. While my research spans across multiple taxa, all tied with a common thread - space. More recently, I started using mathematical approaches and try to integrate theoretical and field research. I'm a lover of streams, tennis, and programming in R. Small gardening became one of my hobbies during quarantine.
