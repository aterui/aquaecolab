### Graduate students

Thank you for expressing interest in our research group! We are actively seeking talented students who have a strong passion for the intersection of freshwater ecology and spatial ecology. Before reaching out to us, it's important to consider whether our research group aligns well with your interests. Are you intrigued by ecological concepts in general or focused on the ecology of specific taxa? If you find yourself captivated by the broader ecological concepts, then our lab may be an excellent fit for you. By joining us, you can gain invaluable experiences as we strive to enhance our understanding of ecological systems. We deliberately select study organisms to facilitate the achievement of this goal.

If you're still interested in joining our research group, please feel free to contact me at a_terui@uncg.edu. For the most up-to-date information regarding graduate applications at UNCG Biology, you can visit [this link](https://biology.uncg.edu/graduate/apply/).

### Postdocs

We are delighted to receive inquiries regarding postdoctoral projects in our research group. If you believe that our research program aligns well with your interests, we encourage you to reach out to us via email at a_terui@uncg.edu. Please include your CV and a concise summary of your research interests, ideally within 1-2 pages.

We are open to developing collaborative projects through postdoctoral fellowships, including the Smith Fellowship and JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship. These fellowships provide excellent opportunities for advancing research and fostering collaboration. You can find more information about the Smith Fellowship at [this link](https://conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows) and explore the JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship options as well.

We look forward to receiving your email and learning more about your research interests.

### Undergraduate students

If you are seeking research experience in our lab, it's important to consider the following questions for self-assessment:

1. **Are you specifically interested in freshwater, quantitative, and spatial ecology?** This research focus is integral to our lab, so it's essential that your interests align with these areas.

2. **Are you able to dedicate a substantial amount of time to research, committing at least 3 hours per week?** Research requires time and dedication, and we value students who are willing to invest the necessary effort.

If you answered YES to both of these questions, we encourage you to contact us via email at a_terui@uncg.edu. Please provide a brief statement outlining your research interests, allowing us to understand your areas of focus.

We look forward to hearing from you and discussing potential research opportunities in our lab.
