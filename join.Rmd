### Graduate students

Thank you for your interest in my research group! I am always looking for talented students with a strong interest in **the intersection of freshwater ecology and spatial ecology.** If you would like to see whether my research group is a good fit, this is something you might want to consider before contacting me. **Are you interested in ecological concepts or ecology of specific taxa?** If the former, you may be a good fit to my lab and may obtain valuable experiences while you are here; we aim to advance conceptual understanding of ecological systems, and we purposefully choose study organisms to achieve this goal.

If you are still interested in my research group, contact me (a_terui at uncg.edu). The most updated information for graduate applications at UNCG Biology is available [here](https://biology.uncg.edu/graduate/apply/).

### Postdocs

I welcome inquiries about postdoctoral projects in our research group. If our research program is a good fit for your interests, please email me (a_terui at uncg.edu) with your CV and a short summary of your research interests (1-2 pages). We can develop collaborative projects through postdoctoral fellowships, such as [Smith Fellowship](https://conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows) and JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship.

### Undergraduate students

If you are interested in getting research experience in our lab, ask the following questions to yourself - (1) **are you interested in freshwater/quantitative/spatial ecology?** (2) **Are you willing to commit substantial amount of time for research (\>= 3 hours a week)?** If you would say YES to both questions, send me an email (a_terui at uncg.edu) with brief statements of your research interests.
