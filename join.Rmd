### Undergraduate students

Students who are interested in freshwater ecology/spatial ecology/quantitative ecology are encouraged to contact me (a_terui at uncg.edu). Opportunities exist to learn field research skills and statistical modeling with R.

### Graduate students

#### Ph.D position
Aquatic ecology lab at UNCG is currently looking for a Ph.D student starting Fall 2021. The student will work on a project investigating fish movement patterns in a small stream. The student will perform data collection in the field and develop statistical models estimating key ecological parameters, such as movement distance and survival. The project is at the interface of behavioral and population ecology, and students who are particularly interested in combining these research fields are encouraged to apply.

#### MS position
Aquatic ecology lab at UNCG is currently looking for a master student starting Fall 2021. The student will work on the statistical modelling of discharge variation in relation to land use and geometries of river networks. The project leverages the public database of discharge and land use. This is part of the project exploring drivers of food chain length in rivers and the student is expected to work collaboratively with current lab members. The student is expected to have a solid understanding in ecology, environmental science, hydrology or related fields. Advanced skills in R and GIS are a big plus.

If interested in either of the above positions, please contact me (a_terui at uncg.edu) with (1) your CV, (2) a one-page research statement describing your previous research experiences and interests, and (3) the names and contacts of three referees. Review of applications begins immediately. The departmental deadline for submitting the application to the graduate studies is January 15, 2021 for Ph.D and April 1, 2021 for MS. If the student is accepted into the graduate program, there is the possibility for financial support in the form of teaching or research assistantships.

### Postdocs

I welcome inquiries about postdoctoral projects in our research group. If our research program is a good fit for your interests, please email me (a_terui at uncg.edu) with your CV and a short summary of your research interests (1-2 pages). We can develop collaborative projects through postdoctoral fellowships, such as [Smith Fellowship](https://conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows) and JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship.
